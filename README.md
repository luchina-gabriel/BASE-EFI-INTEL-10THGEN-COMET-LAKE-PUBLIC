	- framebuffer-patch-enable - Uncomment if no BIOS options for iGPU memory.
	- framebuffer-stolenmem - Uncomment if no BIOS options for iGPU memory.

- PLEASE EDIT/ADD DEVICE FOR ETHERNET i225 (You can identify with Hackintool on `PCIe` tab).
	- If your board didn't ship with the Intel I225 NIC, there's no reason to add this entry.
	- If you get a kernel panic on the `AppleIntelI210Ethernet` kext, your Ethernet's path is likely `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)`.
	- Please **`ENABLE`** Patch for i225 on `Kernel > Patch`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.2.1 and below, please add `dk.e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.3 or newer, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Ventura, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args` and add Kext [AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext](https://github.com/luchina-gabriel/youtube-files/raw/main/AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext.zip)

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series & RX 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).
-wegnoegpu|Used for disabling all other GPUs than the integrated Intel iGPU, useful for those wanting to run newer versions of macOS where their dGPU isn't supported.

### Ethernet (Intel i225) `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
dk.e1000=0|Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it is required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.<br>You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.
e1000=0|for macOS 12.3.1 or newer<br>Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it is required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.<br>You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.

# BIOS Settings

### Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot

- CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)
	- This must be off, if you can't find the option then **`ENABLE`** `AppleXcpmCfgLock`. 
	- Your hack will not boot with `CFG-Lock` enabled.

### Enable
- VT-x
- Above 4G decoding. 
	- This must be on, if you can't find the option then add `npci=0x2000` to `boot-args`. 
	- Do not have both this option and `npci` on `boot-args` enabled at the same time.
	- 2020+ BIOS Notes: When enabling Above4G, Resizable BAR Support may become an available on some Z490 and newer motherboards. Please ensure this is **`DISABLED`** instead of set to Auto.
